{x} Create Repository in KSU-IS
{x} Update the README file
{x} Create this RoadMap file
{x} Find related repository 
{x} Create main code file
{x} Begin looking into modifying KSUScraper 
{x} Start writing code for program
{x} Look at manufacturer websites for club stats and recommendations
{x} Create some "foundational" code that the manufacturer/club information will eventually be put into
{x} Test "foundational" code
{ } Have a modified KSUScraper that works for multiple sets of clubs/manufacturers
{ } Incorporate modified KSUScraper code into program
{ } Test a simplified version of program 
{ } After testing initial version, begin expanding the breadth of club sets available
{ } Begin working on presentation.
{ } Test the program to see if it is working with expanded club sets.
{ } Once this foundational program is working explore possibilites of utilizing a technology to analyze a video
{ } Determine if I can actually utilize the technology with my coding knowledge.
{ } If possible to utilize the visual technology begin working on it.
{ } Refine the program to potentially handle errors and fix bugs. 
{ } Finalize project repository to turn in
{ } Finalize Presentation
