# At-Home-Golf-Fitter
Program to fit yourself for golf clubs based on swing data

This program at the basic level will be able to take swing data input such as ball speed,
swing speed, club face angle, etc. It will then take that data and compare it to the data 
in the file to determine which clubs the user should look into and it will
go out and pull information about that set of clubs from a manufacturers website.
